The model relies on two key developments: the generation of virtual diffraction signatures of dislocated crystals and the development of a surrogate model to predict dislocation density from diffraction profiles. First, two algorithms are introduced for the generation of diffraction profiles from discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations. Both algorithms leverage the full-field spectral computation of the elastic strain fields generated in the presence of dislocations. However, the two algorithms differ in their treatment of correlations in the elastic strain field; the impact of this difference on the shape of diffraction peaks is emphasized. A database containing 220 virtual diffraction profiles is generated from networks of dislocations in Al using the correlation-dependent algorithm. This dataset is employed to train and test a surrogate model. Predictions consistently yield dislocation densities within a 90% confidence interval of +30% to −41%, which is an improvement over prior dislocation density prediction methods. It is thus demonstrated that the simultaneous use of virtual diffraction and data analytics can yield alternative models for the analysis of diffraction line profiles in which uncertainty can be quantified for complex dislocation networks.","tags":null,"title":"Virtual Diffraction Analysis of Dislocations and Dislocation Networks in Discrete Dislocation Dynamics Simulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Khanh Q.

Specifically, mobility laws for straight screw, 30 degree, 60 degree and edge dislocations are atomistically derived for different combinations of Escaig stress and stress normal to the (111) slip plane. MD simulations show that the mobility of each dislocation is distinctly influenced by non-Schmid stresses. Furthermore, MD simulations of dislocation shear loop expansion show that mobility laws derived from straight dislocations are applicable to describe the more complex behavior of stress-state dependent expansion of a dislocation loop. Data describing the dislocation mobility laws are incorporated into discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations using a hierarchical multiscale approach. DDD simulations of isolated dislocation loop expansion show strong agreement with MD simulation results, validating the nonlinear multiscale implementation. DDD simulations of dislocation network evolution show that the use of stress state dependent dislocation mobility laws provides quantifiable changes to the plastic deformation path, which leads to different final microstructures. The results presented here demonstrate the key role that local stresses, experienced by the dislocation core, play on the evolution of a dislocation network during plastic deformation.","tags":null,"title":"Mobility of Dislocations in Aluminum: The Role of Non-Schmid Stress State","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Khanh Q.

First, mobility laws for straight screw, 30°, 60°, and edge dislocations are calculated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Each atomistic mobility law is described by an empirical piecewise function with a character angle dependent power law exponent to capture the nonlinear damping regime. For the dislocation velocity range considered in this work, the mobilities of screw and 60° dislocations are lower than edge and 30° dislocations. The mobilities of mixed dislocations, such as 30° and 60°, are found to depend on the character of the leading Shockley partial. Second, MD simulations of dislocation loop expansion under a constant external Schmid stress are performed. The expanded dislocation loop is found to facet in the 60° and screw segments due to low mobilities. The dislocation loop is also found to have reflection asymmetry about the edge axis due to mixed dislocation mobility asymmetry. Finally, the nonlinear atomistic mobility laws are implemented into DDD simulations to illustrate that atomistic mobility laws for straight dislocations can describe faceting and asymmetric behaviors observed during dislocation loop expansion in higher length scale simulations.","tags":null,"title":"Mobility of Dislocations in Aluminum: Faceting and Asymmetry during Nanoscale Dislocation Shear Loop Expansion","type":"publication"}]
